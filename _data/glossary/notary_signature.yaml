meaning: |
  The Notary Signature is the `<signature>` tag within a Receipt.
  It's an [RSA Blind Signature](/signatures.html) of the contents of the Receipt, seriallized as described below.
  
  The subject of the blind signature is the concatination, in this order, of the following key-value pairs:  
  `domain`, `item`, `signer`, `time`, `units` _if there is one_, `amount` _if there is one_, `plan` _if there is one, and `uuid`.  
  String values should have any double-quote characters removed, and should be enclosed in double-quotes.  
  `time` should use the normal decimal integer representation: no leading zeros, sign, decimal-point, or thousands-markers.  
  `amount` should use _signed_ decimal representation: no _extra_ leading or trailing zeros, `.` decimal-point, no thousands-markers.
  `uuid` should use just the lower-case hex bytes without braces, dashes, or quotes.  
  This will be hashed and signed as a utf-8 string.

  The public key for a given Notary, identified by the Receipt's `signer` field, is assumed to be known by the Client and Host.
  
example: |
  Given an abstract receipt such as

  - domain: `https://www.example.com/`
  - item: `This is "technically" a valid item string.`
  - signer: `https://receipts.dmn.network/path`
  - time: 1557944008
  - units: `USD`
  - amount: 5.0000001Ã—10^-6
  - uuid: {{bf9c1367-9589-41ff-8f74-134877341cce}}

  one would serialize it as

  ```text
  domain"https://www.example.com/"item"This is technically a valid item string."signer"https://receipts.dmn.network/path"time1557944008units"USD"amount0.0000050000001uuidbf9c1367958941ff8f74134877341cce
  ```
  
  which might yeild a Notary Signature like

  ```text

  ```

  to be used in the Receipt XML.

subject: Receipts-Menu Header
path: /http.html#glossary_menu_header
meaning: |
  A `Receipts-Menu` header should be included with any page that uses resources for which receipts will be required,
  so that the Client will know what Receipts to get _before_ requesting those resources.
  A menu header will contain a single absolute url to a [menu.xml](xml.html#glossary_menu_xml) file
  which contains the current page or resource in its scope.
  Any page or resource _may_ be served with a menu header. For some applications it may make sense to always give a single value for every request.
  An empty menu header will be treated the same way as no header at all.
  
  There are two equivalent ways of representing a menu header. Only one should be used in any given response:  
  In many cases it will be sufficient to include an HTML `<meta>` tag.  
  The `Receipts-Menu` HTTP header is equivalent and can be used with non-HTML resources.  
example: |
  ```html
  <meta property="receipts:menu" content="https://www.example.com/menu.xml" />
  ```
  ```text
  Receipts-Menu: https://www.example.com/menu.xml
  ```

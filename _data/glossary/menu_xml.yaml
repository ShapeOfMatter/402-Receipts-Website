subject: menu.xml
path: /xml.html#glossary_menu_xml
meaning: |
  A menu.xml lists resources (possibly HTML pages, but more frequently images or snippets) for which Receipts are accepted or required. 
  While browsing within the scope of a menu.xml, no resources should be needed that require receipts except as specified in that menu.  
  For many websites it will be feasible to have a single menu who's scope is the entire website.
example: |
  We provide two example menu.xml files. These links go directly to the xml files:
    
  - [/menu_example_small.xml](/menu_example_small.xml)
  - [/menu_example_large.xml](/menu_example_large.xml) (Also shows a broader variety of Receipt Definitions)

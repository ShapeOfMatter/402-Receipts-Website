meaning: |
  A menu.xml lists resources (possibly HTML pages, but more frequently images or snippets) for which Receipts are accepted or required. 
  While browsing within the scope of a menu.xml, no resources should be needed that require receipts except as specified in that menu.  
  For many websites it will be feasible to have a single menu who's scope is the entire website.

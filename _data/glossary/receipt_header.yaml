  path: /http.html#glossary_receipt_header

    and an ongoing discussion of how it will be signed and its textual representation.
402_response:
  subject: '402 Response Code'
  path: /http.html#glossary_402_response
  meaning: |
    A 402 HTTP response indicates that the request should/may be retried with a receipt as described in the `Receipts-Accepts` header.
    To the extent possible, 402 should be the “rejection of last resort” in the sense that a 402 response should not be given
    if the request would have failed for other reasons in addition to the absence of a suitable `Receipts-Receipt` header.
    
    A `Receipts-Accepts` header is mandatory for a 402 response.
    
    If a 402 response has a response body, that body should be used as a placeholder for the requested resource, and must be appropriate for such use.
    If a 402 response has a `Link: <url>; rel=alternate` header, then it must specify a placeholder for the requested resource and there should not be a body.

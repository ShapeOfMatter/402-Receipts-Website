subject: '498 Response Code'

meaning: |
  A 498 HTTPS response indicates that the `usestamp` included in the receipt attached to the request
  did not match the `Receipts-Nextstamp` header returned the _previous_ time that receipt was submitted. 
  
  The purpose of the nextstamp/usestamp is to prevent receipt-sharing.
  As an enforcement mechanism, the Host may choose to flag its record of the receipt, and possibly any other receipts with the same public key,
  as invalidated, i.e. to reject all future Receipt Submissions

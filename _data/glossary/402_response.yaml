subject: '402 Response Code'

meaning: |
  A 402 HTTPS response indicates that the request should/may be retried with a (valid, applicable) Receipt as described in the `Receipts-Accepts` header.
  To the extent possible, 402 should be the “rejection of last resort” in the sense that a 402 response should not be given
  if the request would have failed for other reasons in addition to the absence of a suitable `Receipts-Submission` header.
  
  A `Receipts-Accepts` header is mandatory for a 402 response.
  
  If a 402 response has a response body, that body should be used as a placeholder for the requested resource, and must be appropriate for such use.
  It should contain human-appropreate messaging explaining the nature of the problem.

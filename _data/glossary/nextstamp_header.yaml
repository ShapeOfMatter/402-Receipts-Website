subject: Receipts-Nextstamp Header
path: /http.html#glossary_nextstamp_header
meaning: |
  The `Receipts-Nextstamp` HTTPS response header provides a single-use token
  which the Client will include in a subsequent submission of the receipt(s) in question.

  The nextstamp should be exactly six lowercase characters a-z. 

  _Ownership_ of a receipt is established by signing each submission of a given receipt with a consistent private key,
  however (because the `usesignature` keys are disposable) there's nothing to prevent users from sharing these keys as well as the receipts.
  The purpose of the nexstamp/usestamp is to prevent sharing of receipts between consumers. The chaining of nextstamp/usestamp values
  makes sharing of receipts _impractical_, and provides a mechanism to detect and invalidate receipts and keys that have been shared;
  see the 498-Response.

subject: Receipt

meaning: |
  A **Receipt** is an XML object describing a particular payment for a particular resource.
  
  The XML document is always expressed as a list of Receipts; the XML root is `<receipts>`.

  [The XSD is here]({{ "/402receipts-receipt.xsd" | absolute_url }})
  
  #### UUID Details<a name="uuid-implementation-details"></a>
  It's the Client's responsibility to generate a random version-4 UUID.
  Use of other UUID types may result in identifiers that are traceable back to the Client's computer, or may risk collisions.
  Uniqueness is only enforceable on the signer/domain/UUID _triplet_;
  the global uniqueness of UUID's can't be relied upon here because a malicious client could deliberately violate it.

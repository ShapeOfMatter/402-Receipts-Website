subject: Cannonical URL
path: /parties.html#glossary_cannonical_url
meaning: |
  A Notary is required to expose a canonical URL endpoint by which they can be identified, and which is _sufficient_ to interact with that Notary.
  
  - A GET request to the canonical URL should return an HTML page which a human could use to complete a purchase and obtain a receipt.
    In practice this page would probably also prompt the user to open an account with the Notary.
    `TODO: specify how a receipt could be passed into this page from the URL hash for blind-signing
    and how the Notary's signature would be communicated back to the Client.`
  - A POST request to the canonical URL is used to obtain a Notary Signature;
    a signature with a pre-approved Client's private key should be sufficient authentication for this.
    `TODO: the details of this process will be filled in as the cryptographic details of receipt signing are determined.`
  - A PUT request to the canonical URL is used by the Host to redeem receipts, in batches.

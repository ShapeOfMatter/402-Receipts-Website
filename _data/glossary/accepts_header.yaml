subject: Receipts-Accepts Header
path: /http.html#glossary_accepts_header
meaning: |
  The `Receipts-Accepts` response header value is
  a [compressed](/compression.html) [Receipt Definition XML object](/xml.html#glossary_receipt_definition).
  The response to a request for a resource for which receipts are accepted must always have a `Receipts-Accepts` header
  if the response represents success (a 2** response) or any receipt- or payment-related failure (including a 402 response).
  In practice it's advisable for the `Receipts-Accepts` header to be constant
  for a given resource regardless of the rest of the details of the response.

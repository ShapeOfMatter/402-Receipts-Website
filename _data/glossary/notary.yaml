notary:
  subject: Notary
  path: /parties.html#glossary_notary
  meaning: |
    The Notary signs the receipt.  
    It is up to the parties involved to agree in advance what is promised when a receipt is signed; 
    here we assume that the Notary has collected the money in question from the Client and will forward those funds to the Host by some outside channel. 
    In this sense the "Notary" is properly thought of as a "Broker".

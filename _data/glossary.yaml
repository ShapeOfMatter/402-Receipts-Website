menu_xml:
  subject: menu.xml
  path: /xml.html#glossary_menu_xml
  meaning: |
    A menu.xml lists resources (possibly HTML pages, but more frequently images or snippets) for which Receipts are accepted or required. 
    While browsing within the scope of a menu.xml, no resources should be needed that require receipts except as specified in that menu.  
    For many websites it will be feasable to have a single menu who's scope is the entire website.
menu_header:
  subject: Receipts-Menu Header
  path: /http.html#glossary_menu_header
  meaning: |
    A `Receipts-Menu` header should be included with any page that uses resources for which receipts will be required,
    so that the Client will know what Receipts to get _before_ requesting those resources.
    A menu header will contain a single absolute url to a [menu.xml](xml.html#glossary_menu_xml) file which contains the current page or resource in its scope.
    Any page or resource _may_ be served with a menu header. For some applications it may make sense to always give a single value for every request.
    An empty menu header will be treated the same way as no header at all.
    
    There are two equivilant ways of representing a menu header. Only one should be used in any given response.
    In many cases it will be sufficient to include an HTML `<meta>` tag. The `Receipts-Menu` HTTP header is equivilant and can be used with non-HTML resources.
    ```html
    <meta property="receipts:menu" content="https://www.example.com/menu.xml" />
    ```
    ```text
    Receipts-Menu: https://www.example.com/menu.xml
    ```
accepts_header:
  subject: Receipts-Accepts Header
  path: /http.html#glossary_accepts_header
  meaning: |
    The `Receipts-Accepts` response header value is a [compressed](/compression.html) [Receipt Definition XML object](/xml.html#glossary_receipt_definition).
    The response to a request for a resource for which receipts are accepted must always have a `Receipts-Accepts` header
    if the response represents success (a 2** response) or any receipt- or payment-related failure (including a 402 response).
    In practice it's advisable for the `Receipts-Accepts` header to be consistent for a given resource regardles of the rest of the details of the response.
receipt_definition:
  subject: Receipt Definition
  path: /xml.html#glossary_receipt_definition
  meaning: |
    A Receipt Definition is an XML object which tells a Client what receipts would be accepted in order to access the relevant resource.
    Receipt Definitions are both the values of the `Receipts-Accepts` HTTPS headers and are part of menu XML objects.
    All menu.xml files covering a given resource, and the `Receipts-Accepts` header for that resource, should give the same Receipt Definitions.
    Receipt Definitions are covered in the same XSD name-space as a menu.xml.
    Note that the root of a Receipt Definition is a `definitions` element, which is a list of `definition`s.
cannonical_url:
  subject: Cannonical URL
  path: /parties.html#glossary_cannonical_url
  meaning: |
    A Notary is required to expose a canonical URL endpoint by which they can be identified, and which is _sufficient_ to interact with that Notary.
    
    - A GET request to the canonical URL should return an HTML page which a human could use to complete a purchase and obtain a receipt.
      In practice this page would probably also prompt the user to open an account with the Notary.
      `TODO: specify how a receipt could be passed into this page from the URL hash for blind-signing and how the Notary's signature would be communicated back to the Client.`
    - A POST request to the canonical URL is used to obtain a Notary Signature;
      a signature with a pre-approved Client's private key should be sufficient authentication for this.
      `TODO: the details of this process will be filled in as the cryptographic detials of receipt signing are determined.`
    - A PUT request to the canonical URL is used by the Host to redeem receipts, in batches.
receipt_header:
  subject: Receipts-Receipt Header
  path: /http.html#glossary_receipt_header
  meaning: |
    The `Receipts-Receipt` HTTP Request header will contain a compressed Receipt submission object.
    See the [Receipts](/receipts.html) page for a more detailed explaination of the contents of a Receipt
    and an ongoing discussion of how it will be signed and its textual representation.
402_response:
  subject: '402 Response Code'
  path: /http.html#glossary_402_response
  meaning: |
    A 402 HTTP response indicates that the request should/may be retried with a receipt as described in the `Receipts-Accepts` header.
    To the extent possible, 402 should be the “rejection of last resort” in the sense that a 402 response should not be given
    if the request would have failed for other reasons in addition to the absence of a suitable `Receipts-Receipt` header.
    
    A `Receipts-Accepts` header is mandatory for a 402 response.
    
    If a 402 response has a response body, that body should be used as a placeholder for the requested resource, and must be appropriate for such use.
    If a 402 response has a `Link: <url>; rel=alternate` header, then it must specify a placeholder for the requested resource and there should not be a body.

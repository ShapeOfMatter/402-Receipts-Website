### Get access. Support creators. Drop ads.

The Direct Monetization Network will be a full-stack suite of tools for creators and their audiences, implementing a 402-based internet payment scheme. 

Go [here]({{"/introduction.html" | relative_url}}) to read draft negative-one of the standard we're building.

This whole website is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ShapeOfMatter/direct-monetization-static); for now that's how to contribute.

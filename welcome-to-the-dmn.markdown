# Welcome to the Direct Monitizatin Network

### Get access. Support creators. Elide ads.

The Direct Monitization Network is a tip-jar _and_ a paywall. It's the opposite of a third-party ad network; you opt in, you keep control of your data and experience, and website creators keep control of their websites.

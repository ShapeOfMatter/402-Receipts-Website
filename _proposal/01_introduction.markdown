# Version negative one.
This document describes a standard way for a website to demand or accept payment for access to resources without having a prior relationship with the customer or at any point collecting any card/bank information. The proposed standard is a suite of HTTPS headers, HTML head elements, and surrounding utilities to make direct monetization of web-accessible resources low-stress and safe even for non-specialist human users.

> #### Goal of this document:
>
> This standard needs to be sufficiently defined that tools within it can be built independently and work together. It must be a suitable tool for producers and consumers, so if you have questions, ideas, or suggestions about the technical details or about the high-level user experience then please reach out to us.
>
> Once the standard is complete in the sense of describing _a_ workable protocol from end to end, we will declare Version 0.0 so that people can start implementing it.

## The name
The 402 HTTPS response code implies that a request is being denied because payment must be provided for the requested resource. [No standard way of following up to a 402 response has been normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#402). The 402 response code has seen only niche usage, mostly for subscription-only APIs, and is effectively non-standard for human-facing HTTPS resources. This standard will fix that.

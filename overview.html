    <p>We propose a suite of HTTPS headers, HTML head elements, and surrounding utilities to make direct monetization of web-accessible resources low-stress and safe even for non-specialist human users.</p>

<p>“Direct monetization” is meant in the sense that the producers of online content are able to make money off of that
content from the audience of the content itself, as opposed to monetizing <em>the attention of the audience</em>, for example
with ad placements. 
“Direct monetization” <em>doesn’t</em> mean that there is no third party besides the consumers and producers of the content.</p>

<p>The current version of this protocol does not include any process for a web host to actually accept funds from a web
client.
Placing a credit-card charge or otherwise transacting funds happens out-of-band, 
both between the consumer and a third-party notary, and between the producer and that same notary (if the producer of
the content is a separate entity from the notary).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We anticipate a tip-jar configuration in which no payment is <em>required</em> to access the resource, but a clear means of making optional payments is exposed to the client along with explicit expectations about what they <em>should</em> pay. Throughout this document we will talk interchangeably about “requiring” or “accepting” receipts. The actual behavior gets specified in the <a href="http://402receipts.info/receipt_definitions.html#glossary_receipt_definition" title="A Receipt Definition is an XML object which tells a Client what receipts would be accepted in order ...">Receipt Definition</a>
.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-do-you-an-end-user-use-this">How do you, an end-user, use this?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="the-very-short-version">The very short version:</h4>
  <p>You’ll sign into an account in a network and, as you browse the web, sites in that network will automatically charge you small amounts for each page you access. You’re protected from fraud and abuse by the network, while the websites get a strong, unobtrusive paywall (or tip-jar).<br />
The protocol itself masks your browsing activity from the network (the Notary).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to participate, you’ll need to create an account with at least one <a href="http://402receipts.info/parties.html#glossary_notary" title="The Notary signs the receipt.   It is up to the parties involved to agree in advance what is promise...">Notary</a>
. You’ll need your web-browser to be logged into some sort of <a href="http://402receipts.info/parties.html#glossary_wallet" title="A wallet is a (presumably encrypted, etc) storage location separate from the Client where receipts o...">Wallet</a>
; this will probably be a browser plugin, but we want to have javascript/cookie based options too. The wallet is the only part of the system that both knows who you are <em>and</em> what you’re doing.<br />
If you aren’t logged in properly, you may see prompts or placeholders as you browse the web.</p>

<p>As you browse the web, websites you visit will tell your web-browser how much their pages cost. They do this using Header tags in the 
underlying HTTPS responses that direct your browser to get a Receipt from the Notary; this happens in the background without you needing to do anything.</p>

<p>When you navigate to a page that costs money, if your wallet is configured to allow the transaction (based on the amount and any details about the website itself), then it will fetch a receipt for the needed amount from the Notary.
This receipt is passed to the website, which then gives you access to the page or content in question. This happens in the background without you needing to do anything; as a human user you only need to worry about the payments system when you’re configuring your accounts.</p>

<h3 id="context-for-a-402-response">Context for a 402 response</h3>
<p>It’s generally poor user experience to reject a web-page request outright. (A <a href="http://402receipts.info/http.html#glossary_402_response" title="A 402 HTTPS response indicates that the request should/may be retried with a (valid, applicable) Rec...">402 Response</a>
 to such a request may work if a suitable placeholder page is available and the <a href="http://402receipts.info/parties.html#glossary_client" title="The Client is an HTTPS client requesting a resource for which a receipt is required.  Typically the ...">Client</a>
 is trusted to handle the response appropriately.)
In practice, it is usually better to give a normal response to the principal request and require receipts for a key resource used by that page, for example an image or text-block.</p>

<h3 id="consumer-tools">Consumer tools:</h3>
<p>We anticipate a distinction between the <a href="http://402receipts.info/parties.html#glossary_client" title="The Client is an HTTPS client requesting a resource for which a receipt is required.  Typically the ...">Client</a>
 (typically a web-browser, possibly with a plugin) and a remote <a href="http://402receipts.info/parties.html#glossary_wallet" title="A wallet is a (presumably encrypted, etc) storage location separate from the Client where receipts o...">Wallet</a>
 which will allow persistence of user-data between clients and devices.</p>

<h3 id="producer-tools">Producer tools:</h3>
<p>Different <a href="http://402receipts.info/parties.html#glossary_host" title="The Host is, by definition, the server receiving the HTTPS request with the `Receipts-Receipt` heade...">Hosts</a>
 will have different needs. 
Typically there will be a server plugin, designated servlet, or specialized CDN, 
that will inspect requests for receipts, validate the receipts, and forward them to their respective Notaries for disbursement.</p>

<h3 id="brokers-and-networks">Brokers and Networks:</h3>
<p>Throughout this standard we speak of a <a href="http://402receipts.info/parties.html#glossary_notary" title="The Notary signs the receipt.   It is up to the parties involved to agree in advance what is promise...">Notary</a>
. The Notary’s role is not just to sign receipts; they also handle the collection of money from consumers and disbursement of it to producers. In the typical case both the host and the client will have a prior relationship (membership or account) set up with one or more Notary; as long as they have one in common the user experience can proceed seamlessly.</p>
